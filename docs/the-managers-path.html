<ul>
<li>
<p>good manager - cares about you as a person, actively works to help you grow your career, teaches you important skills, gives you valuable feedback, help navigate difficult situations, helps you understand what is important to focus on, and enables you to have that focus. Identifies and assigns stretch projects to help you grow and learn new things but also help you understand the value of the work you're doing, even when its not fun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one-on-one meetings: create human connection between you and your manager - establish real trust by being vulnerable in front of each other. Don't use one-on-ones as a status meeting. Come prepared with an agenda.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The most mundane work can turn into a source of pride when you understand how it contributes to the overall success of the company.</p>
<p>As you become more senior, your manager expects you to bring solutions, not problems</p>
<h3>Mentoring</h3>
<p>good mentor - discuss projects, whiteboard, pair program. Assists when you're stuck.</p>
<p>Listen: understand the mentee is probably nervous and trying their best to please you. They may not ask questions when they don't understand things. Get those questions out of him - the odds of you spending all your time answering questions are slim compared to the odds that your intern will go off in the absolute wrong direction because they didnt ask enough questions.</p>
<p>communicate: Ask them to explain a piece of code to you, point to documents that explain it. Provide nudging and clarity along the way to keep them going in the right direction</p>
<p>adjust to responses: learn the frequency with which you need to check in with them.</p>
<p>Mentoring provides the opportunity to cultivate curiousity and see the world through fresh eyes.</p>
<h3>Tech Lead</h3>
<p>Role of tech lead is to continue to write code but with the added responsibilities of representing the group to management, vetting our plans for feature delivery, and dealing with a log of the details of the project management process.</p>
<p>Scales themselves by delegating work effectively without micromanaging. Use their expertise at a larger scale so the whole team gets better.</p>
<p>Influencing without authority.</p>
<p>Roles a tech lead plays:</p>
<ul>
<li>system architect/business analyst: identify critical systems that need to change and the features that need to be built in order to deliver upcoming projects.</li>
<li>project planner: break down work into rough deliverables so that the team can work in parallel</li>
<li>software dev/team leader: write code, communicate challenges, and delegate</li>
</ul>
<p>Stone of triumph - achieve recognition only to discover the recognition comes at a heavy price - tech leads rarely get salary/title bumps/training</p>
<p>The value of planning isn't that you execute the plan perfectly, that you catch every detail beforehand, or that you predict the future; it's that you enforce the self-discipline to think about the project in some depth before diving in and seeing what happens.</p>
<p>The plan itself is less important than spending time on the act of planning.</p>
<p>Explain things to upper management in a nonthreatening and non condescending way.</p>
<p>Your manager isn't great at handing you plum assignments that showcase your talents to the whole organization; she expects <em>you</em> to tell <em>her</em> where these opportunities live.</p>
<p>Be careful of relying on process to solve problems that are a result of communication or leadership gaps on the team.</p>
<p>Good tech lead:</p>
<ul>
<li>understands the architecture, data flow, how it reflects the products it supports</li>
<li>is a team player. Don't do all the interesting work yourself. Look at the tricky/boring/annoying areas and unstick them.</li>
<li>leads technical decisions. Always solicit opinions of the team.</li>
<li>communicate - your productivity is less important than the productivity of the team</li>
</ul>
<h3>Managing People</h3>
<p>build trust and rapport - why did you decide to work here? what are you excited about? do you have any career goals that I should know about so that I can help you achieve them? any surprises since you've joined, good or bad?</p>
<p>create a 30/60/90 day plan with the developer</p>
<p>get new hires to work through and update the new hire documentation</p>
<p>communicate expectations early</p>
<p>get feedback</p>
<p>have regular 1-1s</p>
<p>1-1 types:</p>
<ul>
<li>todo list meeting: both parties come with objectives to cover in order of importance. Updates are given, decisions are made, planning happens</li>
<li>the catch-up: listen to anything the report wants to discuss. Don't allow the discussion to turn into therapy</li>
<li>the feedback meeting: review progress on goals, discuss performance issues</li>
<li>the progress report: only use the 1-1 as a status meeting for side projects without oversight.</li>
<li>getting to know you: ask about long-term goals. Let them talk about personal lives.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep 1-1 notes in a shared document</p>
<p>don't micromanage; autonomy is an important element of motivation - devs to have control over some part of their work. Conversly, delegation is not the same as abdication - talk about which meetings to attend to help, provide guidance for escalations, point out responsibilities, provide measurable goals and a plan.</p>
<p>gather info from the system before going to the people</p>
<p>create a culture of continuous feedback - regularly share positive and corrective feedback rather than saving these comments for the review cycle. Adopt a habit of identifying people who deserve praise.</p>
<p>There should be no surprises to feedback - especially negative ones. You should coach and guide a bunch before formalizing a pip.</p>
<p>Many organizations have an "up or out" culture for early-career employees.</p>
<h3>Managing a Team</h3>
<p>Management is not a natural progression of the skills of a senior engineer, it's an entirely new set of skills and challenges.</p>
<p>Need to hold people accountable for their decisions, make sure that decisions pass the technical smell test and have been blaanced against the overall context of the team and the business.</p>
<p>Its important for technical managers to still be in the code - should be able to identify and prioritize technical debt, guide what is/isn't possible, identify the shortest path to implement new features.</p>
<p>Common problems in dysfunctional teams:</p>
<ul>
<li>not shipping: find and remove bottlenecks in the tools and processes.</li>
<li>people drama: let go or transfer toxic employees.</li>
<li>overwork: slow down product roadmap, deal with tech debt, cut features</li>
<li>collaboration problems: gather actionable feedback and have productive conversations about possible improvements. Find opportunities for team building/social events</li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than focusing on shielding people from wider politics/drama, help the team understand important goals</p>
<p>create a data-driven culture by gathering stats on team productivity, quality (time spent on outages, number of bugs found by QA or after releases). Understand what will have the greatest impact.</p>
<p>hold retrospectives</p>
<p>how to manage conflict:</p>
<ul>
<li>don't rely exclusively on concensus or voting</li>
<li>set up clear processes to depersonalize decisions - start with a shared understanding of goals, risks, questions</li>
<li>if there are problems, address them immediately rather than letting the simmer</li>
</ul>
<p>goal should be to build a team where there is a psychological safety net - memebers should be willing to take risks and make mistakes in front of one another.</p>
<p>openly refuse to tolerate bad behavior</p>
<p>project planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 productive engineering weeks per quarter - vacations, meetings, review sessions, production outages, onboarding take the other 3 weeks.</li>
<li>budget 20% of time for tech debt</li>
<li>as deadlines approach, your job is to say no</li>
<li>for initial estimates - take your guess, then double it. For bigger tasks, push for planning time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Managing Multiple Teams</h3>
<p>Directors are responsible for overall department technical competence - guiding and growing that competence in the whole team as necessary via training and hiring. They debug and triage critical problems, should understand the systems they oversee well enough to perform code reviews, and help research problems as needed. They contribute to architecture and design by ensuring the technology aligns with the business. They are responsible for creating and growing the next generation of engineering management. They are responsible for balancing immediate and long term product work with technical debt.</p>
<p>Time management - understand the difference between important and urgent.</p>
<p>Prepare for meetings - make agendas, hold people accountable, make sure the meeting has a clear procedure and expected outcome.</p>
<p>Delegation strategy - if its simple and frequent, delegate (running standups, doing simple code reviews). If its simple and infrequent, do it yourself. If its complex and frequent, delegate. If its complex and infrequent, delegate for training purposes.</p>
<p>Strategies for saying no</p>
<ul>
<li>say "yes and" where you agree but also articulate the sacrifices/downsides of saying yes.</li>
<li>say "no" with a set of hard requirements needed to say yes</li>
<li>go through a line of questioning so that the person realizes its not a good idea</li>
<li>say no quickly rather than dragging something on</li>
</ul>
<p>advocate and push for technical process improvements to increase engineer productivity</p>
<ul>
<li>code should be checked-in frequently. Encourage this by teaching tdd.</li>
<li>work to reduce incidents rather than simply react to them as they come.</li>
</ul>
<p>When joining a new team, don't focus on whats broken but identify existing strengths and cultivate them.</p>
<p>Strong teams are built on shared purpose and value alignment.</p>
<h3>Managing Managers</h3>
<p>open-door policies dont work - you need to find problems proactively</p>
<p>have skip-level meetings</p>
<ul>
<li>meet with people who report to people who report to you. Hold ~1/quarter. Provide prompts for potential topics.</li>
<li>best/worst aspects of project</li>
<li>who on your team has been doing really well</li>
<li>feedback about your manager</li>
<li>changes we could make to the product</li>
<li>opportunities we're missing</li>
<li>how do you think the org is doing overall?</li>
<li>any areas of business strategy you don't understand?</li>
<li>what's keeping you from doing your best work right now?</li>
<li>how happy are you working here? what could we do to make work more fun?</li>
<li>learn which areas you need to support the manager</li>
</ul>
<p>Universal rule of an employee - manager or first timer - they should make your life easier.</p>
<p>New hires act in self-interest until they get to know their colleagues, and then they move to group interest.</p>
<p>make it clear that your goal is to understand what people do so that you're capable of appreciating it better</p>
<p>solving team problems</p>
<ul>
<li>form a hypothesis</li>
<li>check the data: tickets, chats, emails, code reviews, calendars</li>
<li>observe the team: drop in on meetings</li>
<li>ask questions: find out goals - people need to feel an understanding and connection with the purpose of their work</li>
<li>check team dynamics: do people like each other? do they collaborate?</li>
<li>jump in to help</li>
<li>be curious - learn <em>why</em></li>
</ul>
<p>People ask why things take so long for two reasons 1) they don't like the original estimate or 2) didn't ask for an estimate and now they're upset. You must be aggressive about sharing estimates and updates to estimates, even when people don't ask.</p>
<p>Showing some empathy for the person providing pressure can go a long way to shifting focus from blame to action.</p>
<p>Dealing with roadmap uncertainty</p>
<ul>
<li>be realistic about likelihood of changing plans</li>
<li>break down projects into a series of small deliverables so that some results are achieved</li>
<li>don't overpromise a future of technical projects</li>
<li>dedicate 20% time to dealing with technical debt</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Big Leagues</h3>
<p>The company looks to you for guidance on what to do, how to act, how to think, and what to value.</p>
<p>Four categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>info gathering/sharing: need to synthesize large amounts of info quick, identify critical elements, and share it with appropriate third parties</li>
<li>nudging: remind people of their commitments by asking questions instead of giving orders</li>
<li>decision making: take conflicting perspectives and incomplete info and set a direction</li>
<li>role modeling</li>
</ul>
<p>The job isn't to be right. It's to help the team make the best possible decisions and help them implement them in a sustainable and efficient way.</p>
<p>VPs balance strategy and management, align dev roadmap with hiring plan.</p>
<p>CTOs are executives first and technologists second - takes strategic thinking and guides technology to solve problems.</p>
<p>Saying something is top priority is one thing, but making the actual tradeoffs on the schedule to get people moving on it is completely different.</p>
<p>Never underestimate the number of times something needs to be said before it sinks in.</p>
<p>Show that you understand your managers priorities and tell them the concrete steps you're taking to meet them.</p>
