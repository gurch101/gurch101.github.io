</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>failed settlement (5-10% of trades fail due to non matching instructions)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>settlement</p>
</li>

<p>reflecting settlment</p>

<h3>What is a trade?</h3>
<p>Legal agreement to buy or sell goods. One party pays cash in exchange for goods, other party receives cash in exchange for goods.</p>
<p>Parties can be investor &#x26; broker, broker &#x26; exchange, broker &#x26; trader, trader &#x26; trader</p>
<h3>Trade Execution</h3>
<p>Historically, between traders on a trading floor where market makers advertise their prices on "pitches"</p>
<p>Currently, automatic execution via electronic exchanges (order-driven markets) or bid/offer prices are quoted to attract investors (quote-driven markets).</p>
<p>trader uses current trading position + average price of current trading position to determine whether to buy/sell at profit/loss.</p>
<p>Investment manager makes an investment decision and communicates an "order" to executing broker. Broker records detail of the order - client account, buy/sell, quantity, security, desired price.</p>
<p>When the broker receives the order, it acts as agent (broker attempts to find a third party willing to trade on terms of order - investment bank makes commission <em>only</em>) or principal (trader trades off investment bank trading book). The broker becomes the counterparty to the trade (broker is investors counterparty and investor is broker's counterparty).</p>
<p>If the trade is made by a fund (ie mutual fund provider), the block level trade needs to be allocated to its underlying funds (splits).</p>
<h3>Trade Capture</h3>
<p>Formally recording details of an individual trade immediately after execution. Trade date/time (dividend entitlements is based on trade date), contractual settlement date (the day securities/cash are exchanged), buy/sell, quantity, security, market, price, internal "owner" (the trader/advisor), counterparty (entity name + location)</p>
<p>If counterparty or security reference data is missing, STP between fo system and ops system can't occur and an exception is raised</p>
<p>A trade is "open" until settlement date. Exposure with counterparty exists until settlement date.</p>
