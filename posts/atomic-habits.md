### The Fundamentals: Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference

### Chapter 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

British Cycling Team - broke down everything, improve each component by 1%, then re-assemble the pieces for a significant increase

1% better every day = 37x better in a year

We often dismiss small changes because they don't seem to matter very much in the moment. Since the results don't come quickly, we slide back to our previous routines. Conversely, single decisions are easy to dismiss.

Success is the product of daily habits, not once-in-a-lifetime transformations

Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits - your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits, your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits, your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits, your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits.

If you want to predict where you'll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses.

An ice cube remains frozen as temperature increases but melts at 32 degrees. A one degree shift, no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change. Habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance.

The hallmark of any compounding process - the most powerful outcomes are delayed.

A stonecutter hammers away at his rock, perhaps 100 times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the 101 blow, it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it - but all that had gone before.

If you want better results, forget about goals and focus on your system instead. Goals set the direction but the system is what makes progress. 
- Winners and losers have the same goals but the difference in the system is what leads to winners.
- Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment
- goals restrict your happiness - either you achieve your goal and are are successful or you fail and are a disappointment. Fall in love with the process.
- goals can create a yo-yo effect - once you achieve it, you stop your habits

The purpose of setting goals is to win the game, the purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.

Your commitment to the process will determine your progress.

### Chapter 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

outcomes = what you get

processes  = what you do

identity = what you believe

outcome-based habits - focus on what you want to achieve

identity-based habits - focus on who you want to become

You may want more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes rather than creates, then you'll continue to be pulled toward spending rather than earning.

You may want better health, but if you continue to prioritize comfort over accomplishment, you'll relax rather than train.

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It's one thing to say I'm the type of person who wants this. It's something very different to say I'm the type of person who is this.

Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.

The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.

### Chapter 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

Behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.

try->fail->learn->try differently. With practice, the useless movements fade away and the useful actions get reinforced.

Habit formation:

cue: the trigger that initiates behavior. Information that predicts a reward (food, water, sex, money, fame, power, status, power, approval, love, friendship, personal satisfaction).

craving: the motivational force behind every habit. Cravings are linked to a desire to change internal state. Thoughts, feelings, and emotions transform a cue to a craving

response: the actual habit you perform

reward: end goal of every habit. Rewards satisfy us and teach us.

cue notices the reward, cravings want the reward, response is the action to obtain the reward.

problem phase: cue + craving
solution phase: response + reward

To create a good habit, make the cue obvious, the craving attractive, the response easy, and the reward satisfying

To break a bad habit, make the cue invisible, the craving unattractive, the response difficult, and the reward unsatisfying

### The First Law: Make it Obvious
### Chapter 4: The Man Who Didn't Look Right

You don't need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice an opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to it. Ex - paramedic who recognized a person was going to have a heart attack just based on appearance.

The more you repeat something, the less likely you become to question what you're doing and why you're doing it. The process of behavior change begins with awareness.

Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.

Use the point-and-call system to reduce mistakes - raises awareness

ask "does this behavior help me become the person I want to be?"

### Chapter 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit

People who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through.

Use this template: I will [behavior] at [time] in [location]

Diderot Effect: obtaining a new possession creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.
- buy a couch now you question the layout of your entire living room
- buy a dress and you need to get shoes and earrings to match

habit stacking: identify a current habit you already do and then stack your new behavior on top.

Habit stacking template: After [current habit], I will [new habit]

### Chapter 6: Motivation is Overrated: Environment Often Matters More

behavior is a function of the person in their environment

Your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you 
- re-arranged cafeteria with water available at more stations reduced soda sales
- when home electrical meters are located in an easy to view location, people use less electricity
- products sold at the end of aisles and at eye level are sold more frequently
- people drink more in social situations than they would alone

train yourself to link habits with particular context

only use your room for sleep. If you aren't sleepy, go into a different room.

Go to new places to set new habits

one space, one use
