### The Fundamentals: Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference

### Chapter 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

1% better every day = 37x better in a year

We often dismiss small changes because they don't seem to matter very much in the moment. Since the results don't come quickly, we slide back to our previous routines. Conversely, single decisions are easy to dismiss.

Success is the product of daily habits, not once-in-a-lifetime transformations

Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits - your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits, your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits, your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits, your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits.

If you want to predict where you'll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses.

An ice cube remains frozen as temperature increases but melts at 32 degrees. A one degree shift, no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change. Habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance.

The hallmark of any compounding process - the most powerful outcomes are delayed.

A stonecutter hammers away at his rock, perhaps 100 times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the 101 blow, it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it - but all that had gone before.

If you want better results, forget about goals and focus on your system instead. Goals set the direction but the system is what makes progress. 
- Winners and losers have the same goals but the difference in the system is what leads to winners.
- Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment
- goals restrict your happiness - either you achieve your goal and are are successful or you fail and are a disappointment. Fall in love with the process.
- goals can create a yo-yo effect - once you achieve it, you stop your habits

The purpose of setting goals is to win the game, the purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.

Your commitment to the process will determine your progress.

### Chapter 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

outcomes = what you get

processes  = what you do

identity = what you believe

outcome-based habits - focus on what you want to achieve

identity-based habits - focus on who you want to become

You may want more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes rather than creates, then you'll continue to be pulled toward spending rather than earning.

You may want better health, but if you continue to prioritize comfort over accomplishment, you'll relax rather than train.

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It's one thing to say I'm the type of person who wants this. It's something very different to say I'm the type of person who is this.

Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.

The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.
