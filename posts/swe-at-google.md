### Chapter 1: What is Software Engineering?

software engineering is just programming with a team over time.

Software is sustainable if you are capable of reacting to whatever valuable change comes along for either technical or business reasons.

Technical debt is the delta between what our code is and what we wish it was.

refactoring and system/dependency upgrades are only important for products with a year/decade lifespan.

Rather than avoiding a painful task, invest in making it less painful. Getting through not only the first big upgrade but getting to the point at which you can reliably stay current going forward, is the essence of long-term sustainability.

Hyrum's Law: With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in the contract: all observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody.

Given enough time and enough users, even the most innocous change will break something. Analysis of the value of the change must incorporate the difficulty in investigating, identifying, and resolving those breakages.

It's far too easy for problems to worsen slowly and never manifest as a singular moment of crisis (boiling frog problem).

The more frequently you change your infrastructure, the easier it becomes to do so in the future due to expertise (more people have experienced an upgrade) and stability (more frequent upgrades usually means fewer changes between releases.

Finding problems earlier in the development workflow usually reduces costs.

All decisions should have good justifications. Important to assess:

- financial costs
- resource costs
- personnel costs
- opportunity costs
- societal costs

Efficiency gains from keeping engineers happy, focused, and engaged can easily dominate other factors.

Jevons paradox: consumption of a resource may increase as a response to greater efficiency in its use. (Ex. M1 macs are an order of magnitude faster, so now we're less concerned with performance).

Every task an org has to do should be scalable. Establishing policies can make processes scalable.
