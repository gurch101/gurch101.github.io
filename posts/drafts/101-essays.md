Consciously learn to regard the "problems" in your life as openings for you to adopt a greater understanding and then develop a better way of living.

Your brain can only percieve what is known, you are psychologically incapable of predicting what will make you happy. Don't try to change your life with the primary goal of increased happiness. Live in the moment instead.

Bad feelings should not always be deterrents - they are also indicators that you are doing something worthwhile.

If you want to change your life, change your beliefs. If you want to change your beliefs, have experiences.

The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way. Problems force you to take action to resolve them.

Most geniuses/experts adhered to rigid and specific routines.

Mood is created from habits - how much we sleep, how frequently we move, what we think, how often we think it. The pattern of continually experiencing a behavior compounts its effect and makes it seem valid.

Happiness is not experiencing more, its experience what you already have in new and different ways.

As children, routine gives us a feeling of safety. As adults, routine gives us a feeling of purpose.

Indifference is a sign you're on the wrong path.

Don't speak in definitives. Never say "this is wrong" - it may be wrong for you but the idea exists because it is right for someone else.

Validate the opposing opinion before presenting your own.

Discomfort occurs on the precipice of change. It usually takes a bit of discomfort to break through to a new understanding, to release a limiting belief, to motivate ourselves to create real change.

Your thoughts create your experiences.

Physical feelings are quick and transient but the ideas we hold of pain seem to stick around.

Joy and anger lasts a few minutes but depression, tension, and sadness can last years.

Suffering is the refusal to accept what it is. Healing is letting yourself feel.

Exercise: focus on how you've changed from a year ago.

Don't be uncomprimisingly set on anything for your future - be fully immersed in the moment and focus on making any situation ideal.

People want comfort and familiarity but this is not where happiness lies. Becoming comfortable with discomfort expands your tolerance for happiness. We prefer the comfort of what we know rahter than the vulnerability of what we don't.

The space between knowing and doing is where suffering thrives.
