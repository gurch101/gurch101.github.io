### Role of gut

original thought was mouth chewed and swallowed food, stomach mechanically ground it with acid, small intestine received bile to digest fat and digestive enzymes to absorb nutrients, large intestine contract and move contents back and forth to absorb 90% of the water and dispose of remainder.

gut can influence basic emotions, pain sensitivity, social interactions

gut has its own nervous system - enteric nervous system

there are more immune cells in the gut wall than circulating in the blood

gut lining has endocrine cells that contain/release hormones into the bloodstream

gut has largest source of serotonin which controls gut contractions, sleep, appetite, pain sensitivity, mood, overall wellbeing. Food, microbes, brain signals influence serotonin release.

gut has more than 100 trillion microbes, 1000 species, and 7 million genes (360 bacterial genes for every human gene)

gut microbiome linked to autism, behavioral abnormalities, neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinsons and Alzheimers, depression

emotions alter gastrointestinal contractions:
- fear decreases stomach contractions but increases intestinal contractions
- anger increases stomach contractions and intestinal contractions
- sadness decreases stomach and intestinal contractions

majority of patients suffering from abnormal gut reactions reflect their emotional state.

stress causes hypothalamus to release stress molecule corticotropin-releasing factor which increases cortisol and norepinephrine which causes the gut to contract more, gut wall to become leaky, colon secretes more water and mucus, resulting in diarrhea

the strength, length, and direction of peristalsis depend on the type of food you have ingested - gut has more time to absorb fat and complex carbs and less for a sugary drink

between meals, waves move from esophagus to rectum every 90 minutes when there is no food left to digest. This stops as soon as you eat.


### Studies

ingestion of pribiotic enriched yogurt for four weeks reduce brain response to negative emotional stimuli

### Disorders

dysbiosis - mix of gut microbes falls out of its healthy stable state causing several gut disorders
    - antibiotics can cause colitis or gut inflammation since it diminishes the diversity and abundance of normal gut microbiota which allows invasion of C. difficile
    - colon inflammation can be rapidly cured by reestablishing gut microbiome through fecal transplant


### Thoughts & Questions

refined sugar should be made illegal

why do antibiotics cause diarrhea? shouldnt removal of microbes lead to undigested food and more bulk?

do everything/anything to reduce stress

eat less often

when eating, concentrate on eating - no distractions

can meditation improve digestion?
