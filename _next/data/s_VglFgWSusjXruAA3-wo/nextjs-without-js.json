In doing so, you get the flexibility and familiarity of building a site with React &#x26; Javascript while also getting the performance and SEO benefits of statically pre-rendering as much of your site as possible.</p>\n<p>By default, Next.js preloads a bunch of javascript regardless of whether your site actually needs it. Really simple sites (like this blog), generally don't need any client-side javascript magic. Statically generated emails would also benefit from avoiding client-side javascript since email clients don't execute javascript.</p>\n<p>Turns out it's really easy to disable <em>all</em> javascript in your Next.js app (provided you are using the canary build and are comfortable using an experimental feature).</p>\n<p>First,</p>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">npm install next@canary</code></pre></div>\n<p>Then, add the following to your page:</p>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword module\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> config <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  unstable_runtimeJS<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>That's it!</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
