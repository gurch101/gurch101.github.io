Food, microbes, brain signals influence serotonin release.</p>\n<p>gut has more than 100 trillion microbes, 1000 species, and 7 million genes (360 bacterial genes for every human gene)</p>\n<p>gut microbiome linked to autism, behavioral abnormalities, neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinsons and Alzheimers, depression</p>\n<p>emotions alter gastrointestinal contractions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fear decreases stomach contractions but increases intestinal contractions</li>\n<li>anger increases stomach contractions and intestinal contractions</li>\n<li>sadness decreases stomach and intestinal contractions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>majority of patients suffering from abnormal gut reactions reflect their emotional state.</p>\n<p>stress causes hypothalamus to release stress molecule corticotropin-releasing factor which increases cortisol and norepinephrine which causes the gut to contract more, gut wall to become leaky, colon secretes more water and mucus, resulting in diarrhea</p>\n<p>the strength, length, and direction of peristalsis depend on the type of food you have ingested - gut has more time to absorb fat and complex carbs and less for a sugary drink</p>\n<p>between meals, waves move from esophagus to rectum every 90 minutes when there is no food left to digest. This stops as soon as you eat.</p>\n<h3>Studies</h3>\n<p>ingestion of pribiotic enriched yogurt for four weeks reduce brain response to negative emotional stimuli</p>\n<h3>Disorders</h3>\n<p>dysbiosis - mix of gut microbes falls out of its healthy stable state causing several gut disorders\n- antibiotics can cause colitis or gut inflammation since it diminishes the diversity and abundance of normal gut microbiota which allows invasion of C. difficile\n- colon inflammation can be rapidly cured by reestablishing gut microbiome through fecal transplant</p>\n<h3>Thoughts &#x26; Questions</h3>\n<p>refined sugar should be made illegal</p>\n<p>why do antibiotics cause diarrhea? shouldnt removal of microbes lead to undigested food and more bulk?</p>\n<p>do everything/anything to reduce stress</p>\n<p>eat less often</p>\n<p>when eating, concentrate on eating - no distractions</p>\n<p>can meditation improve digestion?</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
