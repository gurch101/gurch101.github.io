<p>Modern apps need rapid iteration, fast releases, zero downtime and an increase in the volume and variety of devices that connect to it.</p>
<p>Cloud-native applications remain stable even when the infra they're running on is constantly changing/failing</p>
<h3>Chapter 2: Running Cloud-Native Applications in Production</h3>
<p>In most orgs, getting software deployed to prod is challenging - process designed to reduce risk and improve efficiency has the opposite effect</p>
<p>inconsistencies in artifacts, configuration, and environments lead to system instability</p>
<p>goal should be easy and frequent releases into production</p>
<p>continuous delivery = the newest possible version of the software is deployable at any time (trunk is always deployable)</p>
<ul>
<li>advantages: can deploy at any time (first mover advantage), allows you to gather feedback early. If you miss dates,
you can release less features</li>
</ul>
<p>traditional delivery = SDLC is front-loaded with development, followed by extensive testing and packaging</p>
<ul>
<li>disadvantages: if you miss dates, testing is compressed (at the expense of quality) or you push dates</li>
</ul>
<p>Before: tested extensively before going to production and were left scrambling on go-live.
After: Plan for failure and intentionally create a retreat path to make failures non-events. Monitor for crashes, latency changes, changes in click-through rates, etc.</p>
