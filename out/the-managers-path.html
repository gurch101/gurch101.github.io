<ul>
<li>
<p>good manager - cares about you as a person, actively works to help you grow your career, teaches you important skills, gives you valuable feedback, help navigate difficult situations, helps you understand what is important to focus on, and enables you to have that focus. Identifies and assigns stretch projects to help you grow and learn new things but also help you understand the value of the work you're doing, even when its not fun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one-on-one meetings: create human connection between you and your manager - establish real trust by being vulnerable in front of each other. Don't use one-on-ones as a status meeting. Come prepared with an agenda.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The most mundane work can turn into a source of pride when you understand how it contributes to the overall success of the company.</p>
<p>As you become more senior, your manager expects you to bring solutions, not problems</p>
<h3>Mentoring</h3>
<p>good mentor - discuss projects, whiteboard, pair program. Assists when you're stuck.</p>
<p>Listen: understand the mentee is probably nervous and trying their best to please you. They may not ask questions when they don't understand things. Get those questions out of him - the odds of you spending all your time answering questions are slim compared to the odds that your intern will go off in the absolute wrong direction because they didnt ask enough questions.</p>
<p>communicate: Ask them to explain a piece of code to you, point to documents that explain it. Provide nudging and clarity along the way to keep them going in the right direction</p>
<p>adjust to responses: learn the frequency with which you need to check in with them.</p>
<p>Mentoring provides the opportunity to cultivate curiousity and see the world through fresh eyes.</p>
