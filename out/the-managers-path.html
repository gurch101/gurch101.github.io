<ul>
<li>
<p>good manager - cares about you as a person, actively works to help you grow your career, teaches you important skills, gives you valuable feedback, help navigate difficult situations, helps you understand what is important to focus on, and enables you to have that focus. Identifies and assigns stretch projects to help you grow and learn new things but also help you understand the value of the work you're doing, even when its not fun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one-on-one meetings: create human connection between you and your manager - establish real trust by being vulnerable in front of each other. Don't use one-on-ones as a status meeting. Come prepared with an agenda.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The most mundane work can turn into a source of pride when you understand how it contributes to the overall success of the company.</p>
<p>As you become more senior, your manager expects you to bring solutions, not problems</p>
